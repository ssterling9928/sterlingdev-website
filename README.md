## üöÄ About This Project

This repository contains the complete source code for my personal portfolio website. It's designed to be a living showcase of my skills in modern web development, from front-end design to back-end deployment. The primary goal was to create a fast, beautiful, and fully responsive experience that effectively tells my story as a developer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was built using a modern, performance-focused tech stack:

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Astro** | Core framework for building a fast, content-focused site. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first CSS for rapid and consistent styling. |
| **TypeScript** | For type safety and a more robust codebase. |
| **Prettier** | For automated, consistent code formatting. |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | For deploying the site to a global, low-latency edge network. |

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Blazing Fast Performance:** Built with Astro to ship minimal JavaScript.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** Looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Interactive UI:** Smooth animations and hover effects create an engaging user experience.
- **Automated Deployment:** Continuous deployment pipeline from GitHub to Cloudflare Workers.


## üåê Deployment

This site is deployed automatically. Every push to the `main` branch on GitHub triggers a new build and deployment via a Cloudflare Worker, ensuring the live site is always up-to-date with the latest changes.
