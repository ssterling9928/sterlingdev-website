                            My journey into technology didn’t start with a
                            formal lesson, but with a simple, irresistible
                            curiosity. From a young age, I was fascinated by
                            computers and video games, and I spent a lot of my 
                            childhood tweaking settings and taking things apart 
                            just to understand the logic behind them. This desire 
                            to understand has never stopped growing inside me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my elementary and high school years, mathematics 
                            and computer related courses quickly became my favorite. 
                            My enthusiasm for the material helped me pick up on new ideas 
                            quickly.  It was during my college courses that everything
                            really came together. I discovered programming, and for the first
                            time, I wasn't just exploring systems—I was building
                            them. That feeling of writing a line of code and
                            seeing an application respond exactly as intended
                            was empowering, which ended up guiding my focus towards
                            C++, C#, and game development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This initial spark ignited a passion for continuous,
                            self-directed growth. My evenings were often spent immersed 
                            in online courses on platforms like Udemy, learning Game Engines
                            like Unity and Unreal Engine, and diving into the intricacies of
                            not just to learn a new language, but to master the
                            entire ecosystem around it. This process of constant
                            learning isn't just a hobby; it’s the core of my
                            development philosophy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have learned technology moves fast, and it's not going to slow down or wait for anyone. 
                            A developer not only needs to be adaptable, but also
                            to be able to master new technologies quickly. The ability to learn
                            new frameworks, languages, and tools is essential to staying relevant
                            in our modern technology field.  I feel that this is my greatest strength
                            as a developer. I thrive on the challenge of learning, and I am always 
                            able to pick up new skills extremely quickly. This has allowed me to
                            expand to a wide range of projects types, from Game development, mobile and computer applications, and even 
                            web development. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This mindset is carried into every project I take on. I feel technology 
                            should make things easier and enjoyable for people. Whether I'm building an immersive 3D world or a simple web page, 
                            my goal is always to create something that is reliable, runs well, and just makes sense to the person using it.
